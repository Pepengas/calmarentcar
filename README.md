# Calma Car Rental - Website Optimization

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented for the Calma Car Rental website.

## Deployment

The website is deployed on Railway.com. To deploy:

1. Push changes to the GitHub repository
2. Railway automatically detects changes and deploys the updated version
3. Use the build command `npm run build` to update minified files before pushing

## Recent Optimizations

### 1. Code Consolidation and Cleanup
- **Combined JavaScript**: Merged separate JS files (`script.js`, `dark-mode.js`, `mobile-menu.js`) into a single file to reduce HTTP requests
- **Consolidated CSS**: Combined styles from multiple CSS files into a single minified file
- **Removed Unused Files**: Cleaned up development tools and temporary files
- **Fixed Redundant Code**: Eliminated duplicate functions and overlapping styles
- **Removed Heroku Dependencies**: Removed all Heroku-specific configurations and moved to Railway

### 2. Performance Improvements
- **Fixed Navbar**: Implemented a fixed header with smooth scroll effect and visual enhancements
- **Reduced File Size**: Decreased overall page weight by removing unused code
- **Improved Loading**: Streamlined the loading sequence of resources
- **Fixed Header Transitions**: Added smooth transitions for header state changes

### 3. Previous Optimizations
- **Image Optimizations**: 
  - Lazy loading for all non-critical images
  - WebP format conversion
  - Proper image dimensions
  - Critical image preloading
- **CSS Optimizations**: 
  - Minification for faster loading
  - Critical CSS prioritization
  - Consolidated stylesheets
- **JavaScript Optimizations**:
  - Deferred loading to prevent blocking rendering
  - Minified scripts for faster loading
  - Optimized code logic and structure

## File Structure

```
index.html                # Main HTML file
dist/                     # Distribution directory
  ├── styles.min.css      # Combined and minified CSS
  └── script.min.js       # Combined and minified JavaScript
images/                   # Optimized image assets
```

## Best Practices Implemented

- **Reduced HTTP Requests**: Combined multiple files to reduce overhead
- **Resource Hints**: Used preconnect for external domains
- **Fetch Prioritization**: Employed fetchpriority for critical resources
- **Fixed Navigation**: Improved UX with fixed header that's always accessible
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensured responsive design is maintained
- **Dark Mode Support**: Maintained seamless theme switching functionality
- **Code Organization**: Structured code with clear sections and comments

## Future Improvement Suggestions

1. Implement proper image CDN for global distribution
2. Add service worker for offline functionality
3. Implement HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for multiplexed connections
4. Further optimize assets with responsive images using srcset
